<p> <b> Authors:</b> Mahsa Elyasi, Gaurav Bharaj </p>
<p> <b> Abstract:</b>
Neural sequence-to-sequence text-to-speech synthesis (TTS),
such as Tacotron-2, transforms text into high-quality speech.
However, generating speech with natural prosody still remains
a challenge. Yasuda et. al. show that unlike natural speech,
Tacotron-2’s encoder doesn’t fully represent prosodic features
(e.g. syllable stress in English) from characters, and result in flat fundamental frequency variations. </p>
<p> In this work, we propose a novel carefully designed strategy
for conditioning Tacotron-2 on two fundamental prosodic
features in English – stress syllable and pitch accent, that help
achieve more natural prosody. To this end, we use of a classifier
to learn these features in an end-to-end fashion, and apply feature
conditioning at three parts of Tacotron-2’s Text-To-Mel Spectrogram:
pre-encoder, post-encoder, and intra-decoder. Further,
we show that jointly conditioned features at pre-encoder and
intra-decoder stages result in prosodically natural synthesized
speech (vs. Tacotron-2), and allows the model to produce speech with more accurate pitch accent and stress patterns. </p>
<p> Quantitative evaluations show that our formulation achieves
higher fundamental frequency contour correlation, and lower
Mel Cepstral Distortion measure between synthesized and natural
speech. And subjective evaluation shows that the proposed
method’s Mean Opinion Score of 4.14 fairs higher than baseline
Tacotron-2, 3.91, when compared against natural speech
(LJSpeech corpus), 4.28. </p>
